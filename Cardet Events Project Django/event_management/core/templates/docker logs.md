üîç View Logs from Docker Containers
‚úÖ 1. Django App Logs
Your Django app is in the container named event_management.

To view the logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs event_management
This will show you the output from your Django runserver or gunicorn command ‚Äî including errors, requests, and print() or logging.info() outputs.

‚è± You can also follow logs in real-time:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs -f event_management
‚úÖ 2. Celery Logs
To see logs for your Celery worker:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs celery_worker
For Celery Beat scheduler:

bash

docker logs celery_beat
‚úÖ 3. Flower Logs

‚úÖ 4. Database Logs (PostgreSQL)

‚úÖ 7. All Logs Together (Optional)
If you want to monitor all logs together in real-time:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose logs -f
Or, for just one service:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose logs -f django # or celery, flower, etc.
üß† Pro Tips
Use Ctrl+C to stop -f (follow) mode

If your logs are too long, you can tail the last 100 lines:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs --tail=100 event_management
You can also add timestamps:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker logs --timestamps event_management
Let me know if you'd like help analyzing any of those logs or setting up structured log output (e.g., logging to a file or sending logs to a service).
